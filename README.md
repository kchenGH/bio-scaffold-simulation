# Scaffold Simulation (Unity URP)

This project attempts to simulate biological scaffolds used in regenerative medicine. These scaffolds are 3D support structures—often made of biocompatible polymers or porous biomaterials—that help guide cell attachment, tissue regeneration, and healing after injury.

In real biomedical applications, these scaffolds provide:

- A temporary framework where cells can grow and organize
- Porosity and lattice geometry that influence nutrient flow, vascularization, and mechanical strength
- A structure that degrades gradually as new tissue forms

The goal of this simulation is to recreate simplified versions of these scaffold architectures using procedural generation. By generating lattice-like networks of nodes (represented as spheres) and controlling their spatial arrangement, porosity, and interaction with surrounding surfaces, the project lays the foundation for future layers of biological modeling.
